Hi, I'm Jake Munson (@yacoubean),

I've been a software developer of various types and in various fields since college graduation (2002). My Bachelor's degree was in Computer Information Systems, from Boise State University. I was a web developer for many years, and then moved into data development (aka data engineer).

Some of the languages I've dabbled in and/or built projects with:  
- javascript
- python
- ColdFusion
- sql
- c#
